====================

Thanks for your interest! In order to keep the code coherent there are some
easy-to-follow rules.

 * Use [StandrdJS](https://standardjs.com/)
 * Commit your changes using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
 * Write test for your modifications (use `mocha` and `chai` modules).
 * Keep the code coverage as high as possible (100% is awesome!). Run `npm run test-coverage` to check it.
 * Proudly add yourself to the authors in `package.json`! :+1:
